# Astro Restaurant Template - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update with your values

# ============================================
# STRAPI CMS CONFIGURATION
# ============================================

# Strapi API URL (REQUIRED for production builds with real content)
# This should point to your Strapi instance without a trailing slash
# Example: https://your-strapi-instance.com
# Local development: http://localhost:1337
PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL=

# Strapi API Token (OPTIONAL)
# Only needed if your Strapi API endpoints require authentication
# Generate this in your Strapi admin panel: Settings > API Tokens
# Leave blank if your content types are publicly accessible
STRAPI_API_TOKEN=

# ============================================
# HOW IT WORKS
# ============================================
#
# DEVELOPMENT MODE (npm run dev):
# - Fetches content from Strapi on each page load
# - Hot reloads when Strapi data changes
# - Falls back to mock data if Strapi is unavailable
#
# BUILD MODE (npm run build):
# - Fetches all content from Strapi once during build
# - Downloads and caches images locally in public/uploads/
# - Generates fully static HTML with embedded content
# - Falls back to mock data if Strapi is unavailable
#
# PREVIEW MODE (npm run preview):
# - Serves the built static files
# - No Strapi dependency - works offline
# - Content updates require a new build
#
# ============================================
# DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW
# ============================================
#
# 1. Update content in Strapi CMS
# 2. Trigger new build (manual or via webhook)
# 3. Astro fetches latest content and rebuilds
# 4. Deploy new dist/ folder to hosting
# 5. Site remains accessible even if Strapi goes down
#
# ============================================
# RESILIENCE FEATURES
# ============================================
#
# ✅ Website builds successfully with or without Strapi connection
# ✅ All images downloaded and stored locally during build
# ✅ Built site (dist/) is fully static and Strapi-independent
# ✅ Graceful fallback to mock data when Strapi is unavailable
# ✅ No white screens or build failures from API errors
# ✅ Content updates require rebuild but site stays online
